cd sploitscan
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### pip

```shell
pip install --user sploitscan
```

- **OpenAI**: Create an account and get an API key at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup/).

### Configuration File

SploitScan searches for a `config.json` in multiple locations by default. It will load the first valid file it finds, in this order:

1. **Custom path passed via `--config` or `-c`**  
2. **Environment variable**: `SPLOITSCAN_CONFIG_PATH`  
3. **Local and standard config-file locations**:  
   - Current working directory  
   - `~/.sploitscan/config.json`  
   - `~/.config/sploitscan/config.json`  
   - `~/Library/Application Support/sploitscan/config.json` (macOS)  
   - `%APPDATA%/sploitscan/config.json` (Windows)  
   - `/etc/sploitscan/config.json`

> **Note**: Only one file is loaded — the first one found in the above sequence. You can place your `config.json` in any of these paths.

A typical `config.json` might look like this:

```json
{
  "vulncheck_api_key":  "your_vulncheck_api_key",
  "openai_api_key":     "your_openai_api_key",
  "openai_base_url":    "openai_supported_base_url",
  "openai_model":       "openai_supported_model", 
  "google_ai_api_key" : "google_api_key",
  "google_model":       "google_supported_model" 
}
```

$ sploitscan.py CVE-2024-21413

[...]

┌───[ 🤖 AI-Powered Risk Assessment ]
|
| 1. Risk Assessment
| -------------------
| The vulnerability identified by CVE-2024-21413 is a critical remote code execution flaw in
| Microsoft Outlook with a CVSS score of 9.8. The impact on business operations can be severe due to
| its high potential to be exploited over a network without any user interactions or elevated
| privileges. This unvalidated input vulnerability (CWE-20) could allow an attacker to execute
| arbitrary code on the target system, thereby compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and
| availability of critical business data and systems. Given its critical rating and the existence of
| multiple exploits on public repositories like GitHub, the likelihood of exploitation is very high.
| This necessitates immediate attention from the security teams to mitigate the risks associated.
|
| 2. Potential Attack Scenarios
| ------------------------------
| An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted email to a victim
| using Microsoft Outlook. Once the email is opened or previewed, the malicious payload would
| execute, allowing the attacker to gain control over the victim's system. The process involves: 1.
| Crafting a malicious email leveraging the specific flaw in email handling within Microsoft
| Outlook. 2. Sending the email to the intended victim. 3. Upon opening or previewing the email, the
| victim’s system executes the malicious code. The potential outcomes of this attack include theft
| of sensitive information, installation of malware or ransomware, and compromising other systems
| within the same network due to lateral movement capabilities.
|
| 3. Mitigation Recommendations
| ------------------------------
| Immediate mitigation recommendation includes: 1. Applying the latest security patches provided by
| Microsoft. Reference: https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-21413 2.
| Implementing network-level protections such as email filtering and network segmentation to limit
| the spread of potential infections. 3. Conducting regular security awareness training for users to
| recognize phishing and malicious emails. 4. Monitoring network and system activity for signs of
| suspicious behavior and unauthorized execution. 5. Regularly backing up critical data and ensuring
| the integrity of backups.
|
| 4. Executive Summary
| ---------------------
| CVE-2024-21413, a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook, poses a
| significant risk to businesses due to its potential to be exploited without user interaction.
| Multiple exploit proofs are publicly available, increasing the likelihood of attacks.
| Organizations must act swiftly by applying the necessary patches from Microsoft, enhancing their
| email security protocols, and educating their staff to identify potential phishing attempts.
| Mitigating this vulnerability is essential to protect sensitive information, maintain business
| integrity, and ensure system availability, thus preventing potential financial and reputational
| damage. Immediate action is crucial to safeguard the organization against this severe threat.

## 🛡️ Patching Priority System

The Patching Prioritization System in SploitScan provides a strategic approach to prioritizing security patches based on the severity and exploitability of vulnerabilities. It's influenced by the model from [CVE Prioritizer](https://github.com/TURROKS/CVE_Prioritizer), with enhancements for handling publicly available exploits. Here's how it works:

- A+ Priority: Assigned to CVEs listed in CISA's KEV or those with publicly available exploits. This reflects the highest risk and urgency for patching.
- A to D Priority: Based on a combination of CVSS scores and EPSS probability percentages. The decision matrix is as follows:
  - A: CVSS score >= 6.0 and EPSS score >= 0.2. High severity with a significant probability of exploitation.
  - B: CVSS score >= 6.0 but EPSS score < 0.2. High severity but lower probability of exploitation.
  - C: CVSS score < 6.0 and EPSS score >= 0.2. Lower severity but higher probability of exploitation.
  - D: CVSS score < 6.0 and EPSS score < 0.2. Lower severity and lower probability of exploitation.

This system assists users in making informed decisions on which vulnerabilities to patch first, considering both their potential impact and the likelihood of exploitation. Thresholds can be changed to your business needs.
